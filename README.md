Ecommerce Data Analysis

Overview

This project involves analyzing ecommerce data to uncover insights about customer behavior, sales trends, and performance metrics. The goal is to help businesses make data-driven decisions and improve their strategies for customer engagement and revenue growth.

Key Objectives

Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset.

Visualize trends such as sales over time, top-performing products, and customer demographics.

Generate insights into customer behavior, such as purchase frequency and average order value.

Identify potential areas for optimization, such as high cart abandonment rates or low-performing categories.

Dataset

Source: The dataset contains transaction-level data from an ecommerce platform.

Columns: Some of the key attributes include:

Order ID: Unique identifier for each order.

Customer ID: Unique identifier for each customer.

Product: Name or category of the product purchased.

Quantity: Number of items purchased.

Price: Price per unit of the product.

Order Date: Date when the order was placed.

Total: Total revenue for the order.

Tools and Libraries Used

Programming Language: Python

Libraries:

Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.

NumPy: For numerical computations.

Matplotlib and Seaborn: For data visualization.

Scikit-learn: For any predictive modeling or clustering (if applicable).

Jupyter Notebook: For documenting and presenting the analysis.

Analysis Steps

Data Cleaning

Handle missing values.

Remove duplicates.

Format data types (e.g., converting Order Date to datetime).

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Summary statistics (mean, median, etc.).

Distribution of key variables (e.g., revenue, order size).

Time series analysis of sales trends.

Visualizations

Revenue trends over time.

Most popular products/categories.

Customer segmentation based on spending.

Insights and Recommendations

Identify top-performing products and categories.

Analyze seasonal trends in sales.

Suggest strategies to increase customer retention and lifetime value.

Key Insights

Products in [specific category] are the most popular, contributing X% to total revenue.

Peak sales occur during [specific time period], suggesting seasonal demand.

Customers in [specific segment] have higher purchase frequencies.

Next Steps

Predict customer lifetime value using machine learning.

Analyze cart abandonment rates and identify reasons for drop-offs.

Implement A/B testing strategies to optimize the user experience.
